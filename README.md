# Simple Timer

Built using the Angular and Electron frameworks for JS.

## Running

To run, ensure you have the following:

* Angular CLI
* npm

Once all you have the above installed, navigate to the project folder in a terminal of your choice and run 

```sh
npm run electron-build
``` 

A window should open.

If you want to change the layout with Angular's live reload, bypass Electron by running 
```sh
ng serve```
